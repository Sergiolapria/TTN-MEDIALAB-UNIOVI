# TNN-MEDIALAB-UNIOVI

The aim of this project is to join The Things Network community, adding LoRa Gateways in the University of Oviedo campus, so different sensors can connect and send data via LoRaWAN.

The devices that we've built are a PAX counter and a Sanitizer, you can find all the information in each folder. In order to join and make easier the way people can use the devices, we've designed an universal PCB that can be used with all of them and it also has additional pins in order to add other modules if its neccesary. Also we used and open source project for a wheater station, that uses the same board than us. 

For all the projects is use cubecell development board: https://heltec.org/project/htcc-ab01/ Compatible with Arduino and Arduino IDE. 

PAX counter project has also an outside design in 3D printing, so it can be fixed in the wall.
