# TNN-MEDIALAB-UNIOVI

The aim of this project is to join The Things Network community, adding LoRa Gateways in the University of Oviedo campus, so different sensors can connect ande send data via LoRaWAN.

The devices that we've built are a PAX counter and a Sanitizer. In orde to join and make easier the way people can use the devices, we've designed an universal PCB that can be used with all of them.
