# THE THINGS NETWORK - MEDIALAB-UNIOVI

The aim of this project is to join [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) initative and experiment with different Internet of Things use cases.

We have placed some LoRa Gateways at the EPI Gij√≥n Campus (University of Ovied) enabling anyone to connect their IoT project through sending data over LoRa technology.

This repository will list & contain the different devices that have been developed:

- **PAX COUNTER**
- **SANITIZER**
- **MINI WEATHER STATION** (a fork slightly modified from this [original project](https://github.com/chrisys/mini-lora-weatherstation))

You can find all the information related to the projects in their respectives folders. 

In addition, to make easier the way people can prototype different IoT devices, we've designed an **Universal PCB** that can be used with all the projects listed and also provides additional pins to connect different sensors or modules.

The Universal PCB has been desgined to use with the [Heltec Development Board](https://heltec.org/project/htcc-ab01/) which is compatible with Arduino and PlatformIO.

You can find more information about the initiative & projects being developed on the official website:
